## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📊 Dashboards

Several dashboards now offer seamless integration with Dashboard Icons. Here are some of the top choices:

- [Homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage)
- [Homarr](https://github.com/ajnart/homarr)
- [Dashy](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy)

### ✨ Usage

To download an icon from the [icons page](#-icons), simply `Right click > Save link as`.

For non-desktop operating systems or those who prefer using the terminal:
*Replace `example` with the icon's name, and `png` with `svg` if needed.*

```sh
curl -O https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/walkxcode/dashboard-icons/png/example.png
```

or

```sh
wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/walkxcode/dashboard-icons/png/example.png
```

**💡 Tip!** Access Dashboard Icons online faster via `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/walkxcode/dashboard-icons/png/example.png`, replacing `example` with the icon name!
